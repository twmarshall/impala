# Variables in the file override the default values from impala-config.sh.
# Config changes for release or features branches should go here so they
# can be version controlled but not conflict with changes on the master
# branch.
#
# E.g. to override IMPALA_HADOOP_VERSION, you could uncomment this line:
# IMPALA_HADOOP_VERSION=3.0.0

# To facilitate building and testing across many possible CDH components,
# we use $CDH_GBN to specify which build we are working against.
# This is determined as follows.
# 1. If $GLOBAL_BUILD_NUMBER is set, use that for $CDH_GBN.
#    In a Cauldron build, this will be set, as well as DOWNLOAD_CDH_COMPONENTS=false.
# 2. If toolchain/cdh_components/cdh-gbn.sh exists, source it to set
#    $CDH_GBN. This will cause subsequent builds in the same $IMPALA_HOME
#    to continue using the same cdh components.
# 3. Query BuildDB for the latest CDH build tagged with impala-minicluster-tarballs,
#    and use that.
# In addition to being used by bin/bootstrap-toolchain.sh to download the
# tarballs to support the minicluster, CDH_GBN is used in {fe,testdata}/pom.xml
# to choose a Maven repository with jars from that specific GBN, though this
# does not currently always work.

# Defer to $GLOBAL_BUILD_NUMBER OR $CDH_GBN, in that order.
