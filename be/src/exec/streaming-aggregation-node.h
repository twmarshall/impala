/// aggregate the rows into its hash table, but if there is not enough memory available or
/// if the reduction from the aggregation is not very good, it will 'stream' the rows
/// through and return them without aggregating them instead of spilling. After all of the
/// input as been processed from child(0), subsequent calls to GetNext() will return any
/// rows that were aggregated in the Aggregator's hash table.
///
/// Since the rows returned by GetNext() may be only partially aggregated if there are
/// memory contraints, this is a preliminary aggregation step that functions as an
/// optimization and will always be followed in the plan by an AggregationNode that does
/// the final aggregation.
