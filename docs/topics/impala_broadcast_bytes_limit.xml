            <indexterm audience="hidden">BROADCAST_BYTES_LIMIT query option</indexterm> Sets the limit
            for the size of the broadcast input based on estimated size.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Impala planner may in rare cases make a bad choice to broadcast a large table or intermediate
            result and encounter performance problems due to high memory pressure. Setting this limit will
            make the planner pick a partition based hash join instead of broadcast and avoid such performance problems.

        <p>
            The default value is 34359738368 (32 GB). A value of 0 causes the option to be ignored.
